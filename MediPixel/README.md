# MediPixel

A Python-based GUI application for medical image visualization, processing, and analysis. This tool is designed for working with medical images in formats like DICOM and standard image formats.

---

## **Features**
- **Image Loading**: Load and display DICOM and other image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- **Noise Addition**: Add Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, or Poisson noise to the images.
- **Denoising**: Apply noise reduction methods such as Median, Bilateral, and Non-local Means filters.
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Improve image quality using:
  - Histogram Equalization
  - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
  - Adaptive Gamma Correction
- **ROI Selection**: Select Regions of Interest (ROIs) for:
  - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) calculation
  - Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) calculation
- **Histograms**: Display pixel intensity histograms with image statistics.
- **Zoom and Field of View**: Dynamically adjust zoom and FOV using sliders and spinboxes. Select the interpolation method to be applied during zoom, such as:
  - Nearest Neighbor
  - Bilinear
  - Cubic
